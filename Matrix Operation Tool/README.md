# Matrix Operations Tool

This is a simple desktop application built with **Python**, **NumPy**, and **Tkinter** that lets you perform basic matrix operations using a graphical interface.  
The goal of this project was to make matrix calculations easier without needing to run commands in the terminal.
## What This Can Do
You can perform the following operations on matrices:

- Add two matrices
- Subtract one matrix from another
- Multiply matrices
- Find the transpose of a matrix
- Calculate the determinant of a matrix

All operations are done through buttons in the interface, and results are shown clearly in a separate output area.
## Tools Used
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy** for matrix calculations
- **Tkinter** for the graphical user interface (comes built-in with Python)
