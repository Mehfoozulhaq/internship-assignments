# Sales Data Analysis and Visualization

This project is a simple data analysis script written in **Python** using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.  
It reads sales data from a CSV file, performs basic analysis, and generates visualizations to better understand sales performance, profit relationships, and correlations between numeric variables.

The goal of this project is to practice data handling and visualization using real-world style datasets.

## What This Script Does
The program performs the following tasks:

- Loads a CSV file containing sales data
- Displays basic information about the dataset
- Calculates the average sales value
- Creates a bar chart showing average sales by category
- Generates a scatter plot comparing sales and profit
- Displays a correlation heatmap for numeric columns

## Libraries Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas** – data loading and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – basic plotting
- **Seaborn** – advanced visualizations
